# Hierarchical POMDPs

This repository contains the implementation of the architecture presented in the article "Knowledge-Based Hierarchical POMDPs for Task Planning". This code implements the architecture initialization and operation stages. Also, only navigation environments can be generated (like the ones shown and evaluated in the article) with different dimensions, observation and transition probabilities.

## Requirements

The following repositories must be installed:

- [AI-Toolbox](https://github.com/Svalorzen/AI-Toolbox): implementation of MDPs, POMDPs and policy solving algorithms.
- [st_tree](https://github.com/erikerlandson/st_tree): implementation of tree structures and methods.
- [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv): employed to draw the navigation environments. Tested with version 3.4.3.
- [JSON for C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

## Run demo

To run the EIR-2021 demo, perform the steps as indicated in the EIR-2021-INSTRUCTIONS.txt file.
